# Unlimited TPS Reports

This is just a fun little application that we want to give prospective new hires to learn    
a little bit about them as a developer.  This is low pressure and asks you to add a simple    
features and also fix a few broken windows along the way.   
   
The expectation is that you not spend a lot of time on the exercise, implementing the feature   
is the primary goal.  Any refactoring or defect discovery you wish to accomplish is optional   
but might give us more insight into your approach, your thinking, and your style.   

This is a React application that runs on Vite. To complete the exercise:    
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone to your machine.
3. Run `npm install`
4. To run the site for development, run `npm run dev`
5. Complete the exercise as described in on the landing page.
6. Make a pull request back to our repository and let us know.

When the pull request is live, we will look at it and give feedback.  
The interview process will continue after we have had a chance    
to process and make a decision. We hope this is a lighter way   
for you to show us what you can do without the pressure of a   
panel of 4 people and a white board.  We'd love your feedback!
